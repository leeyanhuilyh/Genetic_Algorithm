# Genetic_Algorithm
This repository contains the Genetic Algorithm code with user input of points.

To run the code in user input mode, use `cities_list = select_points(20)`, where 20 could be replaced with however many cities you want.

To run TSPLIB benchmark tests, you may specify the tests included in the `data` folder, or download your own TSPLIB tests.
